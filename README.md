# depsck: dependencies check
Some extra, unofficial, tools to check/update relations between
dependencies of ports.

## finddepsrow
List port's dependencies as a row.

Output dependencies found by `finddeps` as a single row, suitable for
the "# Depends on:" line in the Pkgfile. Dependencies from core are
omitted. The wrapper also checks if any libs are missing by calling
`revdep`.

## missdeps
Check for missing deps of all packages that are installed.

This tool uses `revdep listinst` to check for missing dependencies of
the packages that are installed, then reports them and outputs their
immediate installed dependents.

## prtdepadd
Adds missing dependencies to a port.

First, `prtdepadd` scans the Pkgfile for existing dependencies, then
calls `finddeps` and merges both back in the Pkgfile. The port must
be installed first.

## revlibpkg
Find which ports contain missing libraries needed by a package.

Unlike `revdep`, which will tell you what packages need to be recompiled
after a `prt-get sysup`, this small tool will report which ports contain
missing libraries required by a certain package. 

It is mainly intended for CRUX systems managed `pkg-get`. For example,
I have set the packages I build on my PC as a packages repository for my
laptop. I have generated the repo by `pkg-repgen` where the dependencies
information is extracted from the respective ports. When I install a
package on my laptop with `pkg-get depinst`, its dependencies will be
pulled, however it may have linked to something more present on my build
system. In this case, `pkg-get` will not be aware of such packages,
that are additionally required. It is also useful when updates are done
by `pkg-get sysup`: some packages may have been recompiled against newer
dependencies. These would be automatically upgraded, however their
dependent packages would still have the same version, and thus would be
ignored in the upgrade.

Instead of running every time `revdep` and then hunting the missing
libraries by `prt-get fsearch`, `revlibpkg` aims to automate things a
bit.

The ports database (and hence .footprints) should be updated for this to
work properly.
